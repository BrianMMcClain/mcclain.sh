I'm currently a Senior Technologist at VMware working on the [Tanzu Developer Center](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/), both as a developer and as a [content creator](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/team/brian-mcclain/). I've always loved learning and experimenting with new technologies, and I love sharing what I learn with others even more.

I joined VMware by way of their acquisition of Pivotal, where as a Principal Product Marketing Manager, I spent quite a bit of time time [talking about what Pivotal had to offer](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/authors/brian-mcclain). Prior to Pivotal, I was a Software Engineer at Basho, working to squeeze every bit of performance we could out of [Riak](https://riak.com/), our flagship NoSQL database. At Warner Music Group, I led the Infrastructure Engineering team where I managed a team that designed, built, and managed their Cloud Foundry-based infrastructure, as well as worked with the development team to help educate and architect their cloud-native applications.
