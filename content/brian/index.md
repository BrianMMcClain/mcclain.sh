I'm a Senior Product Education Engineer at HashiCorp, primarily focusing on [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). I've always loved learning and experimenting with new technologies, and I love sharing what I learn with others even more.

Prior to HashiCorp, I worked at VMware as a Staff Technologist on the [Tanzu Developer Center](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/), both as a developer and as a content creator. I joined VMware by way of acquisition through Pivotal where I was a Principal Product Marketing Manager, [talking about what Pivotal had to offer](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/authors/brian-mcclain). 

At Basho I was a Software Engineer working to squeeze every bit of performance we could out of [Riak](https://riak.com/), our flagship NoSQL database. At Warner Music Group, I led the Infrastructure Engineering team where I managed a team that designed, built, and managed their Cloud Foundry-based infrastructure, as well as worked with the development team to help educate and architect their cloud-native applications. Before all of that, I started my career at Diebold, an ATM manufacturer. There I was a part of the Emerging Technologies team, where I helped evaluate new technologies that we thought might help enhance Diebold's products and services.

I've co-authored a book ([Getting Started with Knative](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/getting-started-with/9781492047025/)) as well as a Pluralsight course ([Managing Applications with Cloud Foundry](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/brian-mcclain)), both of which I found great enjoyment in creating. I've given several conference talks at events such as Cloud Foundry Summit, VMworld, and OSCON, ranging from 100's of attendees to a dozen during lunch.

On the personal side, I like to focus on things that help me unwind. That may be through a good movie or video game, lifting, boxing, kayaking, or just enjoying the calmness of a lazy weekend afternoon.
