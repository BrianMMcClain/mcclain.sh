## 2025 films

### 2025 highlights

- **[Freaky Tales](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21942598):** Far and away the most unique and fun film of 2025 that I saw. It has its share of flaws, but by the time the credits rolls I was still sitting there with a smile on my face, already wanting to rewatch it.
- **[Blue Moon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32536315):** Richard Linklater and Ethan Hawke truly are a legendary duo. Hawke had more lines crammed in this 100 minute film than any other movie I can think of off the top of my head, and I could have listened to him for another 100. Beautiful, funny, devastating, and a must-see.
